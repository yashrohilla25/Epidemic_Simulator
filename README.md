Epidemic Spread Simulation (Interactive SIR Model)
=================================================

This simulation uses agent-based modeling rather than purely mathematical differential equations. Each individual in the system is represented as a moving dot within a bounded environment. As individuals move and interact, infections occur based on distance and probability, and recovery happens after a specified time. The evolving counts of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals are plotted in real time, offering a clear visual understanding of epidemic progression.

🎯 Key Features

Agent-Based SIR Simulation
Individuals move freely; infections spread through proximity-based interactions.

Real-Time Visualization
Live animation of the environment and an updating infection curve graph.

Intervention Controls

Vaccination: Start simulation with pre-immune individuals

Lockdown: Restrict movement to reduce infection spread

Adjustable parameters for infection probability, recovery time, population size, etc.

Self-Generated Data
No external datasets required; the system simulates all activity internally.

🧠 Purpose

The project was developed as part of the Simulation and Modelling (UCS751) course to make epidemiological concepts more intuitive. It bridges the gap between theoretical epidemic models and real-world behaviors by providing a visual, interactive environment for experimentation.

This tool is ideal for:

Students learning epidemiology or simulation

Educators demonstrating epidemic dynamics

Researchers conducting conceptual experiments

Anyone interested in understanding disease spread visually

🔮 Future Enhancements

SEIR model integration

Network-based contact structure

GUI for real-time parameter control

Real-world dataset integration
